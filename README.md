# ffu-counter

A Python-based tool to detect and count **Focus Forming Units (FFUs)** from fluorescence microscopy images. Includes a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for accessibility in virology labs without programming expertise.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive interface.
* **Multiple Image Format Support**: Compatible with various microscopy image formats.
* **Automated Counting**: Accurate and rapid FFU quantification.
* **Data Export**: Export results in common formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).
* **Batch Processing**: Process multiple images simultaneously.
* **No AI, Classical Computer Vision**: Relies solely on OpenCV-based algorithms without any machine learning or neural networks.

## üìù About

**Note:** This software operates entirely without training data or neural networks. All FFU detection and counting algorithms are based on proven OpenCV techniques (color thresholding, morphology operations, contour analysis, watershed splitting, etc.).
